Project Odin - Landing Page project

This project was done with HTML and CSS. The goal was to create an entire web page from a design
that Project Odin provided. The project needed to be as close to the design as possible. 
Creating the page from scratch and getting various elements in more or less the right position relative
to the rest was one of the main objectives when constructing the page. I used the CSS box model and flex 
design pattern to put everything in place. The following theme for the page is a game studio with various
images of console games and animated shows for a conceptual art look.
